# TUI Keyboard Shortcuts Guide

Use this doc whenever adding or editing keyboard shortcuts. The goal is to
avoid terminal/OS collisions, preserve common TUI conventions, and keep
behavior consistent across tools.

## Scope
- Applies to all Autarch TUIs (Bubble Tea + lipgloss).
- Defines safe defaults, common conventions, and keys to avoid.

## Safe Defaults (Low Collision Risk)
- Navigation: arrows, PageUp/PageDown, Home/End
- Actions: Enter (activate), Esc (cancel/back), Tab/Shift+Tab (focus),
  Space (toggle), Backspace (go back/delete)
- Function keys: F1–F12 (e.g., F2 for agent selector)

## Common Letter Bindings (Only When Not in Text Input)
- `?` help
- `q` quit
- `j`/`k` down/up
- `h`/`l` back/forward (esc is also back)
- `g`/`G` top/bottom
- `/` search
- `n`/`p` next/prev
- `r` refresh
- `1-9` tabs or sections

## Avoid or Handle Carefully
- `ctrl+c`, `ctrl+z`, `ctrl+\`: terminal signals
- `ctrl+d`: EOF
- `ctrl+s`, `ctrl+q`: flow control (XON/XOFF) unless disabled
- `ctrl+l`: clear screen
- `ctrl+v`, `shift+insert`: paste (should be left to terminal)
- `alt`/`meta` combos: sent as Esc prefix; may collide with Esc handling

## Text Input Rules
- Do not capture printable characters when an input is focused.
- Keep standard editing keys working (arrows, backspace, delete).
- Enter should submit/accept; Esc should cancel/blur.

## Checklist for New Shortcuts
- Consistent with existing TUI Keybindings in `AGENTS.md`.
- No conflicts with terminal-reserved keys.
- Documented in the tool help overlay and `AGENTS.md`.
- Manually tested in a real terminal (not just IDE terminal).
