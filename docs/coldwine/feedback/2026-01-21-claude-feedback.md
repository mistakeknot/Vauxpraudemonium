# Claude Feedback - Tandemonium
**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Context:** Portfolio review for Anthropic job application visibility

---

## Strategic Assessment

### Project Value
Tandemonium is **architecturally ambitious** - a TUI-first task orchestration platform coordinating multiple AI agents. It demonstrates:
- Sophisticated Go architecture
- Multi-agent coordination thinking
- Integration with praude, MCP Agent Mail, Claude Code

### Visibility Challenge
Complex to explain quickly. The value is in the **coordination patterns**, not a flashy demo.

### Best Positioning
"I built infrastructure for AI agents to collaborate on code" - then point to pattern-royale as the visual proof.

---

## Gaps Identified

### Obvious Gaps
1. **Mid-transition state** - Moving from worktrees to hybrid lock model
2. **MCP Agent Mail parity incomplete** - Missing `reply_message`, `renew_file_reservations`
3. **No public demo** - Complex setup, hard to try

### Non-Obvious Gaps
1. **Human-in-the-loop not visible** - The review workflow exists but isn't showcased
2. **No failure recovery documentation** - What happens when agents conflict?
3. **Agent coordination patterns not extracted** - Valuable patterns buried in implementation

---

## Recommended Open Source Integrations

### High Priority: Study These Frameworks

**[CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/open-source)** - 30k GitHub stars
- Simpler multi-agent coordination
- Study their task delegation patterns
- Compare to your approach

**[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)** - Graph-based workflows
- Persistent state across interactions
- Conditional logic and hierarchical control
- Good patterns for your coordination layer

**[AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)** - Microsoft's framework
- Async agent collaboration
- Chat-like coordination APIs
- Research-oriented patterns

**Don't adopt wholesale** - study their patterns:
- How they handle agent memory
- Task delegation protocols
- Failure recovery

### Medium Priority: TUI Polish

**[Huh?](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh)** - Beautiful forms
- For task creation wizards
- Agent assignment flows
- Review workflows

### Low Priority: Visualization

**[Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid)** - Diagram generation
- Visualize task dependency graphs
- Show agent coordination flows
- Auto-generate from task state

## Action Items

### This Week (High Impact, Low Effort)
- [ ] Document 3 coordination patterns from your implementation
- [ ] Write comparison: Tandemonium vs CrewAI vs LangGraph approach
- [ ] Add failure recovery documentation

### This Month (High Impact, Medium Effort)
- [ ] Complete MCP Agent Mail parity (reply_message, renew_file_reservations)
- [ ] Create architecture diagram (Mermaid)
- [ ] Record demo: "Multi-agent task execution with human review gates"

### Future (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Extract coordination patterns into standalone library
- [ ] Benchmark: task completion time with/without coordination
- [ ] Case study: "Building a feature with 3 parallel agents"

## Coordination Patterns to Document

### Pattern 1: Task Executor Isolation
```
task-orchestrator spawns task-executor
    → executor gets isolated context
    → executor reserves files
    → executor implements
    → executor marks 'review'
    → task-checker verifies
    → human approves
```

### Pattern 2: File Reservation Protocol
```
Before editing:
    file_reservation_paths(paths, exclusive=True)
    → Check for conflicts
    → If conflict: wait or notify
    → If granted: proceed
After editing:
    release_file_reservations()
```

### Pattern 3: Human Review Gate
```
Agent completes task → 'review' status
task-checker verifies → generates report
Human reviews report → PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL
PASS → 'done'
FAIL → back to 'pending' with feedback
```

These patterns are **more valuable than the code** for Anthropic visibility.

## Blog Post Idea

**"What I Learned Building a Multi-Agent Task Orchestrator"**

1. Why existing frameworks didn't fit
2. The coordination problem (file conflicts, task dependencies)
3. My approach: hybrid lock + patch-queue
4. Comparison to CrewAI/LangGraph/AutoGen
5. The human-in-the-loop requirement
6. Lessons for anyone building agent systems

---

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 3 coordination patterns documented
- [ ] MCP Agent Mail parity complete
- [ ] Architecture diagram in README
- [ ] 1 comparison blog post
