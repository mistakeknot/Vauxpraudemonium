# Claude Feedback - praude
**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Context:** Portfolio review for Anthropic job application visibility

---

## Strategic Assessment

### Project Value
praude demonstrates sophisticated Go CLI design with TUI-first architecture. It's a good showcase of:
- Bubble Tea mastery
- Agent orchestration patterns
- PRD/specification discipline

However, it's **less Twitter-visible** than pattern-royale or tldr-swinton because:
- PRD tools are niche (PM audience, not general dev)
- No visual demo appeal
- Requires context to understand value

### Best Use
Position praude as **infrastructure that powers your other projects** rather than a standalone showcase.

---

## Gaps Identified

### Obvious Gaps
1. **No public release** - Not on GitHub publicly, not installable via `go install`
2. **Interview flow could be more polished** - Functional but not delightful
3. **No demo video** showing the TUI in action

### Non-Obvious Gaps
1. **No integration showcase** - How does praude → Tandemonium → Claude Code flow work?
2. **Missing "before/after"** - Show a PRD created with praude vs without
3. **Agent orchestration not visible** - The codex/claude agent integration is powerful but hidden

## Recommended Open Source Integrations

### High Priority: Form Polish

**[Huh?](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh)** - Beautiful forms from Bubble Tea creators
- Designed for interview/wizard flows
- Integrates seamlessly with Bubble Tea
- Much less code for polished inputs

Current interview flow could become:
```go
form := huh.NewForm(
    huh.NewGroup(
        huh.NewInput().
            Title("What problem does this solve?").
            Value(&problemStatement),
        huh.NewSelect[string]().
            Title("Priority").
            Options(
                huh.NewOption("Critical", "critical"),
                huh.NewOption("High", "high"),
                huh.NewOption("Medium", "medium"),
            ).
            Value(&priority),
    ),
)
```

### Medium Priority: Prompt Testing

**[Promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo)** - Test agent prompts
- Ensure codex/claude agents produce consistent output
- Catch regressions when prompts change
- Build confidence in agent orchestration

### Low Priority: Structured Output

**[Instructor-go](https://github.com/instructor-ai/instructor-go)** - Structured LLM outputs
- More robust PRD parsing from agent responses
- Retry logic built-in
- Type-safe extraction

## Action Items

### This Week (Low Effort)
- [ ] Record 60-second demo video of TUI interview flow
- [ ] Add Huh? for select/input components
- [ ] Create "before/after" PRD comparison in README

### This Month (Medium Effort)
- [ ] Document the praude → Tandemonium → Claude Code workflow
- [ ] Add promptfoo tests for agent prompts
- [ ] Consider public GitHub release

### Future (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Web-based PRD viewer (read-only, for sharing)
- [ ] Integration tests with real agents
- [ ] Case study: "Building X feature using praude"

## Integration Story to Tell

The powerful story isn't praude alone - it's the ecosystem:

```
praude (PRD generation)
    ↓
.praude/specs/PRD-001.yaml
    ↓
Tandemonium (task orchestration)
    ↓
Claude Code agents (implementation)
    ↓
MCP Agent Mail (coordination)
```

**Blog post idea:** "From Idea to Implementation: How I Use AI to Manage the Full Development Lifecycle"

---

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Huh? integrated for interview polish
- [ ] Demo video recorded
- [ ] Integration story documented
- [ ] At least 1 "before/after" PRD example
