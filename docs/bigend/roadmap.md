# Vauxhall Roadmap

> Multi-project AI agent mission control dashboard

## Vision

Vauxhall provides a unified web interface for monitoring and coordinating multiple AI coding agents working across different projects. It aggregates data from Praude (PRDs), Tandemonium (tasks), MCP Agent Mail (coordination), and tmux (sessions) into a single dashboard that shows:

- **What agents are active** and what they're working on
- **Project health** across all your repositories
- **Live terminal output** from agent sessions
- **Communication threads** between agents
- **File reservations** and potential conflicts

Think of it as "mission control" for your AI engineering team.

## Milestones

### M0: Foundation (Done ✅)

**Goal:** Basic project scaffolding and discovery

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Project structure | ✅ | Go modules, internal packages |
| Configuration | ✅ | TOML config, CLI flags |
| Project discovery | ✅ | Scans for .praude/, .tandemonium/ |
| Web server | ✅ | net/http + htmx + Tailwind |
| Basic templates | ✅ | Dashboard, projects, agents, sessions |
| Initial commit | ✅ | Compiles and runs |

**Deliverable:** `./vauxhall --scan-root ~/projects` starts a web server showing discovered projects.

---

### M1: tmux Integration

**Goal:** See all tmux sessions and identify which ones have agents

| Task | Priority | Complexity | Description |
|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| List sessions | P0 | Low | Parse `tmux list-sessions` output |
| Session metadata | P0 | Low | Created time, window count, attached status |

| Agent detection | P1 | Medium | Heuristics to identify claude-code/codex sessions |
| Session → Project linking | P2 | Medium | Match session CWD to project paths |

**Agent Detection Heuristics:**
- Session name patterns: `*-claude`, `*-codex`, `claude-*`, `codex-*`
- Window title contains "claude" or "codex"
- Recent output contains agent signatures (thinking indicators, tool calls)
- CWD matches a known project with .tandemonium/ or MCP Agent Mail registration

**Deliverable:** Dashboard shows all tmux sessions with agent indicators and project associations.

---

- Standalone MCP Agent Mail: `~/.agent_mail/` or project `.agent_mail/`

**Deliverable:** Agents page shows all registered agents with inbox counts, clicking shows message history.

---

### M5: Live Terminal Streaming

**Goal:** Watch agent terminal output in real-time

**Considerations:**
- Security: who can control agents?
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Agent-specific launch configs (codex vs claude)

**Deliverable:** UI buttons to start/stop agents, send messages.

---

### M8: Multi-Host Support (Future)

Deferred for now. Local-only by default; revisit when a concrete need appears.

**Config Example:**
```toml
[[hosts]]
name = "local"
scan_roots = ["~/projects"]

[[hosts]]
name = "ethics-gradient"
ssh = "ethics-gradient"
scan_roots = ["/root/projects"]
```

**Deliverable:** Single dashboard showing agents across local and remote machines.

## Implementation Order

```
M0 ──► M1 ──► M2 ──► M3 ──► M4 ──► M5 ──► M6
       │      │      │      │
       │      └──────┴──────┘
       │             │
       │      (can parallelize)
       │
       └──► M7 (after M4)
            │
            └──► M8 (after M7)
```

**Recommended sequence:**
1. **M1 (tmux)** - Most visible impact, shows sessions immediately
2. **M2-M4 (data readers)** - Can be done in parallel by different agents
3. **M5 (terminal streaming)** - High value, depends on M1
4. **M6 (activity feed)** - Depends on M2-M4
5. **M7-M8 (control, multi-host)** - Future enhancements

## Technical Decisions

### Why Go?
- Matches Praude/Tandemonium stack (team familiarity)
- Single binary deployment
- Excellent concurrency for WebSockets
- html/template + embed for self-contained binary

### Why htmx over React/Vue?
- Minimal JavaScript complexity
- Server-rendered HTML is simpler to maintain
- htmx handles dynamic updates elegantly
- Tailwind provides styling without build step

### Why SQLite read-only?
- Tandemonium/Agent Mail already use SQLite
- No need to duplicate data
- Read-only prevents accidental corruption
- Can query directly without API layer

### Why not extend Tandemonium instead?
- Tandemonium is single-project focused
- Vauxhall needs cross-project aggregation
- Separate tool = cleaner separation of concerns
- Can run Vauxhall without Tandemonium

## Open Questions

1. **Agent naming**: Should Vauxhall assign its own names, or rely on MCP Agent Mail names?
   - *Leaning:* Use MCP Agent Mail names when available, generate for unregistered sessions

2. **Persistence**: Should Vauxhall have its own DB for activity history?
   - *Leaning:* Yes, for cross-project activity timeline and faster queries

3. **Authentication**: Should there be any auth for the web UI?
   - *Leaning:* No for v1, assume trusted network (localhost/Tailscale)

4. **Mobile**: Should the UI be mobile-responsive for phone monitoring?
   - *Leaning:* Nice to have, not critical for v1
