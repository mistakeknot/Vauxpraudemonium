# Autarch

> See `AGENTS.md` for comprehensive development guide.

## Overview

Unified monorepo for AI agent development tools:
- **Bigend**: Multi-project agent mission control (web + TUI)
- **Gurgeh**: TUI-first PRD generation and validation
- **Coldwine**: Task orchestration for human-AI collaboration
- **Pollard**: General-purpose research intelligence (tech, medicine, law, economics, etc.)

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Build and run
./dev bigend --tui    # Bigend TUI mode
./dev bigend          # Bigend web mode
./dev gurgeh          # Gurgeh TUI
./dev coldwine        # Coldwine TUI

# Pollard CLI
go run ./cmd/pollard init           # Initialize .pollard/
go run ./cmd/pollard scan           # Run all hunters
go run ./cmd/pollard scan --hunter github-scout
go run ./cmd/pollard scan --hunter openalex   # Multi-domain academic
go run ./cmd/pollard scan --hunter pubmed     # Medical research
go run ./cmd/pollard report         # Generate landscape report
go run ./cmd/pollard report --type competitive
go run ./cmd/pollard watch --once    # Single competitor watch cycle
go run ./cmd/pollard watch           # Continuous monitoring

# API servers (local-only by default)
go run ./cmd/pollard serve --addr 127.0.0.1:8090   # Pollard research API
go run ./cmd/gurgeh serve --addr 127.0.0.1:8091    # Gurgeh spec API (read-only)

# Gurgeh spec quality
go run ./cmd/gurgeh history <spec-id>       # Spec revision changelog
go run ./cmd/gurgeh diff <spec-id> v1 v2    # Structured version diff
go run ./cmd/gurgeh prioritize <spec-id>    # Agent-powered feature ranking

# Build all
go build ./cmd/...

# Test
go test ./...
```

## Key Paths

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cmd/` | Entry points for each tool |
| `internal/{tool}/` | Tool-specific code |
| `pkg/tui/` | Shared TUI styles (Tokyo Night) |
| `docs/{tool}/` | Tool-specific documentation |
| `pkg/signals/` | Cross-tool signal types |
| `.pollard/` | Pollard data directory (sources, insights, reports) |
| `.pollard/watch/` | Competitor watch state |
| `.gurgeh/specs/history/` | Spec version snapshots |

## Design Decisions (Do Not Re-Ask)

- Module: `github.com/mistakeknot/autarch`
- Shared TUI package with Tokyo Night colors
- Bubble Tea for all TUIs
- htmx + Tailwind for Bigend web
- SQLite for local state (read-only to external DBs)
- Local-only by default: servers bind to loopback; remote/multi-host deferred; non-loopback requires explicit opt-in + auth
- tmux integration via CLI commands
- Pollard tech hunters use free API tiers (no auth required)
- Pollard general-purpose hunters: some require API keys (USDA, CourtListener)
- Intermute for cross-tool coordination (REST + WebSocket + embedded in-process; first-class Spec, Insight, CUJ entities)
- Legacy tool names (Vauxhall/Praude/Tandemonium) still work via aliases
